DESCRIPTION
===========

myspell (pronounced misspell) reports spelling exceptions (i.e., words
from files, or stdin, that are not found in the combined system and
private dictionaries, possibly after stripping word suffixes) as a
sorted list of unique words, or locators and words, on stdout.

A word to be spell checked may contain any ASCII letter or apostrophe,
or any character in the range 128..255.  All other characters are
silently ignored.

With suitable locale-specific dictionaries, and optionally, suffix
rules, myspell can check spelling for files in any human language that
can be encoded in ASCII, or any of the ISO 8859-n code pages, or
Unicode in UTF-8 encoding, provided that whitespace separates words.
[Languages that lack word separators, such as Lao and Thai, require
sophisticated grammatical analysis to identify words.]  For Unicode,
some prefiltering may be needed to remove Unicode punctuation
(otherwise, it will simply be reported as spelling exceptions).

If the files to be spell checked contain document markup, that markup
should usually be stripped by a suitable initial filter step; see the
EXAMPLES section below.

OPTIONS
=======

myspell options can be prefixed with either one or two hyphens, and can
be abbreviated to any unique prefix.  Thus, -h, -hel, and --help are
equivalent.

To avoid confusion with options, if a filename begins with a hyphen, it
must be disguised by a leading absolute or relative directory path,
e.g., /tmp/-foo or ./-foo.  Alternatively, precede the file list with
the -- option.

`--'
     Everything following on the command line is a filename, even if it
     looks like an option.

`-?'
     Same as -help.

`-dictionary dictfile'
     Add dictfile to the list of system dictionaries.  If a locale is
     set, there may be locale-dependent dictionaries already in the
     list.  This option may be used any number of times.

     If this option is not specified, and no locale is set, then myspell
     will use a built-in list of system dictionaries.

`-help'
     Display a brief help message on stderr, giving a usage
     description, and then terminate immediately with a success return
     code.

`-locale name'
     Set the locale temporarily to name, which must be an ISO country
     code and name of a directory in the myspell installation tree.
     This selects the language of the documents to be spell checked.

`-privatedictionary dictfile'
     Add the private dictionary dictfile to the list of private
     dictionaries that augment the system dictionary.  Typically, this
     is a document-specific list of exceptional words known to be
     correctly spelled.  This option may be used any number of times.

     For spell(1) compatibility, this option may be abbreviated to
     +dictfile.

`-strip'
     Strip word suffixes according to user-defined or locale-specific
     rules.  This usually reduces the number of false reports.

`-suffixrules rulefile'
     Supply additional suffix rules in rulefile.

     This option may be abbreviated to =rulefile.

`-verbose'
     Include a location report of the form filename:linenumber: as a
     prefix of every spelling exception, and sort the report by
     location.  This option may be abbreviated to a single letter.

`-version'
     Display the program version number and release date on stderr, and
     then terminate immediately with a success return code.

`+dictfile'
     Shorthand for -privatedictionary dictfile.  This option may be
     used any number of times (unlike in spell(1)).

`=rulefile'
     Shorthand for -suffixrules rulefile.  This option may be used any
     number of times.

EXAMPLES
========

In these examples, we use file suffixes of .ser (spelling errors) for
exception lists, and .sok (spelling okay) for private dictionaries, but
these are merely conventions, without significance for myspell.

          myspell report.txt > report.ser
          myspell +report.sok report.txt > report.ser
          deroff *.rno | myspell -s french.sfx > temp.ser
          detex *.tex | myspell -p mydict.sok > temp.ser
          dehtml *.html | myspell -l fr =french.sfx > temp.ser
          dexml *.xml | myspell -locale da > temp.ser
          dexml *.xml | myspell -l da =danish.sfx > temp.ser

DICTIONARIES
============

Dictionaries are simply lists of words known to be correctly spelled,
stored one word per line, without any leading or trailing whitespace.
Unlike dictionaries for other spell checkers, those for myspell need
not be sorted.  However, if dictionaries are to be shared between spell
checkers, they should be kept sorted, and for each language, the locale
used for the sort must be consistent.

Once the input is free of spelling errors, the output of myspell will
be a list of exceptional words that are not in the current
dictionaries, but are known to be correct.  They can be added to a
private dictionary that is used on subsequent runs, thereby reducing
the size of future reports.

There are numerous sources of word lists for various languages on the
Internet (search for word list with your favorite search engine), e.g.,

          ftp://ftp.ox.ac.uk/pub/wordlists/
          ftp://ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext96/pgw*
          ftp://qiclab.scn.rain.com/pub/wordlists/
          http://www.phreak.org/html/wordlists.shtml


Dictionaries for other spell checkers can usually be trivially adapted
for use with myspell.

In addition, any corpus of text in a single language that is known to
be relatively free of errors can be easily filtered with tr(1) and
sort(1) to produce a candidate spelling dictionary for any language
that is not yet supported by myspell.  Internet archives of articles,
books, reports, theses, and even news stories can often be readily
located by Web search engines.

SUFFIX RULES
============

Suffix rules guide reduction of the input word lists to reduce
dictionary sizes and reduce false reports.  As such, they are entirely
optional.

Suffix rules are defined in simple text files that contain one rule per
line, beginning with a suffix regular expression, and followed by a
possibly-empty list of replacement suffixes, one of which may be the
empty string, indicated by adjacent quotation marks. Comments run from
sharp (#) to end of line, and blank lines are ignored.

Here is a short example for English:

 
          '$                      # Jones' -> Jones
          's$                     # it's -> it
          ed$     "" e            # breaded -> bread, flamed -> flame
          ied$    ie y            # died -> die, cried -> cry
          ly$     ""              # acutely -> acute
          s$                      # cats -> cat


While suffix rules suffice for many Indo-European languages, others
don't need them at all, and still others have more complex changes in
spelling as words change in case, number, or tense.  For such
languages, the simplest solution seems to be a larger dictionary that
incorporates at least all of the common word forms.

BUGS
====

No options are provided to select language variants, such as American,
Canadian, and British English.  These can still be handled with
supplemental dictionaries specified with the -dictionary or
-privatedictionary options.

Much more work needs to be done to provide language-specific
suffix-rule files, and to collect dictionaries for many more languages.
