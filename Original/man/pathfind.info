File: pathfind.info,  Node: SYNOPSIS,  Next: OPTIONS,  Prev: NAME,  Up: Top

SYNOPSIS
========

pathfind [ --all ] [ --?  ] [ --help ] [ --version ] envvar [ file(s) ]

OPTIONS
=======

pathfind options can be prefixed with either one or two hyphens, and
can be abbreviated to any unique prefix.  Thus, -v, -ver, and --version
are equivalent.

To avoid confusion with options, if a filename begins with a hyphen, it
must be disguised by a leading absolute or relative directory path,
e.g., /tmp/-foo or ./-foo.

`-all'
     Search all directories for each specified file, instead of
     reporting just the first instance of each found in the search path.

`-?'
     Same as -help.

`-help'
     Display a brief help message on stdout, giving a usage
     description, and then terminate immediately with a success return
     code.

`-version'
     Display the program version number and release date on stdout, and
     then terminate immediately with a success return code.

DESCRIPTION
===========

pathfind searches a colon-separated directory search path defined by
the value of the environment variable, envvar, for specified files,
reporting their full path on stdout, or complaining filename: not found
on stderr if a file cannot be found anywhere in the search path.

pathfind's exit status is 0 on success, and otherwise is the number of
files that could not be found, possibly capped at the exit code limit
of 125.

For example,

          pathfind PATH ls


reports

          /bin/ls


on most Unix systems, and

          pathfind --all PATH gcc g++


reports

          /usr/local/bin/gcc
          /usr/bin/gcc
          /usr/local/gnat/bin/gcc
          /usr/local/bin/g++
          /usr/bin/g++


on some systems.
